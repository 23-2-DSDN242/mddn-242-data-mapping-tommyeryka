## Nocturnal Study Trip: Sip and Flip: Tripping on Knowledge with Energy Drinks

At first, my original intention was to create visual compositions derived from patterns, particularly exploring the recognition of shapes and objects within repetitive designs. I had initially planned to focus on capturing the essence of a tivaevae, but I encountered difficulties in obtaining satisfactory images of this subject. This compelled me to come up with an alternative concept, but what could it be?

After numerous days and nights of dedicated research and project work, I eventually settled on the idea of conveying the sensation of being a late-night student. I observed that I had started consuming a considerable amount of energy drinks to help me power through my exam preparation and project tasks. I believed that this could serve as an interesting starting point.

My goal was to emphasize the energy drink can while visually representing the amalgamation of sleep deprivation and caffeine's effects, as they manifested to me. I aimed to capture the pre-energy drink experience, where everything seemed both brilliantly illuminated yet shrouded in darkness, making it challenging to concentrate on tasks, while the energy drink appeared even more luminous, almost as if one's subconscious insisted it was indispensable. I wanted to accentuate this so that viewers would be compelled to take notice.

In my approach, I instructed the AI to single out each Rockstar can by a specific blue and orange/pink hue, with the background deliberately rendered in a fuzzy, pixelated manner and color-inverted. The oversaturation of background colors contributed to a glitch-like texture, which, in my view, added an intriguing dimension. Additionally, I slightly stretched the images to impart a sense of dissociation or zoning out.

It feels as if one is in a distorted, parallel dimension.
